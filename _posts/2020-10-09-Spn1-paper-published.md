A project I worked on studying the transcription elongation factor Spn1 was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa745">published in Nucleic Acids Research</a>.
Spn1 is a transcription elongation factor which recent evidence suggests has histone chaperone activity.
In this project, my collaborator constructed a system to deplete Spn1 from yeast cells, and used this system to study the *in vivo* functions of Spn1 by depleting Spn1 and assaying various aspects of transcription and chromatin state.

I analyzed the resulting genomic data, which included RNA-seq as well as ChIP-seq of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), RNAPII post-translational modifications, transcription elongation factors, histones, and histone modifications.
An archive of these data analyses is available at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3901642">Zenodo</a>.

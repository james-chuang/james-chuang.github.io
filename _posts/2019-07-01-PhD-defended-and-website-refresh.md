A couple weeks ago I defended my PhD dissertation, in which I analyzed genomics data to study two transcription elongation factors and an unusual form of transcription called intragenic transcription.
The first `git commit` I made on code related to the dissertation happened on May 16<sup>th</sup>, 2017, meaning that the work going into my dissertation took just over two years! (Grad school still took six years since I restructured my PhD halfway through to focus on data analysis without experimental work.)
If you are curious, bored, or a transcription enthusiast, you can look at <a href="/assets/jc_thesis_2019_07_02.pdf" target="_blank">the dissertation</a> and <a href="/assets/jc_thesis_presentation_2019_06_19.pdf" target="_blank">the slides I used at my defense</a>.
The code I used to generate these documents is also available on <a href="https://github.com/james-chuang/dissertation" target="_blank">my github page</a>.

Since I'll be on the job market soon looking for jobs with interesting data to analyze, I updated the personal website that you're on now with new content and a new theme based on <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" target="_blank">Minimal Mistakes</a>.
My notes on statistics/machine learning now appear as PDFs on a dedicated <a href="/notes/">notes/files page</a>, and I have added a <a href="/projects/">projects page</a> for projects I've worked on.

I grew up in Michigan, and went to Johns Hopkins University to study biomedical engineering.
In the summer of my sophomore year, my roommate was taking part in the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) team competition, and since I had nothing else lined up, I decided that I would take part too.
Luckily, I was assigned to work in the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/boeke-lab/boeke-lab" target="_blank">Jef Boeke lab</a>.
With no lab experience and little supervision, I was thrown into the deep end and had to learn fast on the job.
By the end of that summer, I had learned the basics of molecular biology, and our team got to present <a href="http://2011.igem.org/Team:Johns_Hopkins" target="_blank">our project</a> at the final competition jamboree in Boston.

From there, I continued working in the Boeke lab under the supervision of an excellent postdoc, Leslie Mitchell.
I learned more about biology and worked on <a href="/projects/dnaassembly/">standardized DNA assembly methods for synthetic biology</a>.
I also contributed to the <a href="http://syntheticyeast.org/" target="_blank">Synthetic Yeast Genome Project</a> through the <a href="http://syntheticyeast.org/build-a-genome/" target="_blank">Build-A-Genome</a> program.

After college, I went to Boston University to do a PhD in biomedical engineering.
I ended up working in the <a href="https://winstonlab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Fred Winston lab</a> at Harvard Medical School, a lab which studies the process of transcription.
During my time in the Winston lab, I was exposed to cutting-edge genomic techniques and the difficulties in analyzing the outputs of these techniques.
At the same time, I wanted to shift my

# Genomic analyses of the<br>transcription elongation factor Spt6

To access the information encoded within a gene, the DNA sequence of the gene must be transcribed to produce RNA.
The process of transcription is carried out by a protein complex called RNA polymerase, and occurs in three stages of initiation, elongation, and termination.
During each of these stages, RNA polymerase is associated with factors which modulate its activity and carry out co-transcriptional processes.

As a graduate student in the <a href="https://winstonlab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Fred Winston lab</a>, I worked on a project studying a protein called Spt6, one of the factors which associates with RNA polymerase during eukaryotic transcription elongation.
One of the major functions of Spt6 is to be a histone chaperone, assisting with the re-assembly of proteins called histones onto DNA.
To study Spt6, my collaborators in the lab generated a number of genomic datasets comparing wild-type yeast cells to yeast cells with a mutation in Spt6, called <i>spt6-1004</i>.
We performed these experiments using yeast because the process of transcription in yeast is very similar to the process of transcription in humans, and yeast is extremely convenient to work with.

The genomic assays my collaborators performed are listed in the following table:

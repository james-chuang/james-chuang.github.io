As an undergraduate in the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/boeke-lab/boeke-lab" target="_blank">Jef Boeke lab</a> when it was at Johns Hopkins, I did wet-lab molecular biology work on standardized DNA assembly methods for expression of genes (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/sb500372z" target="_blank">yeast Golden Gate</a>), and entire pathways (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv466" target="_blank">VEGAS: Versatile genetic assembly system</a>) in *S. cerevisiae*.
The use of standarized DNA parts allowed us to combinatorially clone pathways in order to vary the expression of genes in the pathway.
As a proof of concept, I applied combinatorial pathway cloning to the biosynthetic pathways for Î²-carotene and the bacterial pigment violacein, generating many yeast strains with different colored colonies in a single transformation.
Some of these colorful yeast strains have been used to make <a href="http://www.yeastart.org/" target="_blank">"Yeast Art"</a>, in which images are produced by growing carefully placed yeast cells on an agar plate.

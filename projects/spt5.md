As a graduate student (now postdoc) in the <a href="https://winstonlab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Fred Winston lab</a>, I am doing data science/data engineering work on a project studying the conserved transcription elongation factor **Spt5**.
In this project, I am analyzing genomic data collected by a collaborator in the lab from *Schizosacchomyces pombe* cells that have been depleted of Spt5 protein.
This work extends upon results published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.023" target="_blank">Shetty <i>et al.</i> (2017)</a> that showed *in vivo* transcriptional elongation defects upon Spt5 depletion and an novel role for Spt5 in regulating antisense transcription.

  <figcaption>Diagram of the dual-shutoff system used to deplete Spt5 from <i>S. pombe</i>. Spt5 is expressed from a thiamine-repressible promoter, and tagged with an auxin-inducible degron tag for specific degradation upon addition of auxin.</figcaption>

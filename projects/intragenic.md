As a graduate student/postdoc in the <a href="https://winstonlab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Fred Winston lab</a>, I did data science work on a project studying potential functions for **intragenic transcription** in wild-type *S. cerevisiae*.

In this project, we applied high-resolution assays of transcription initiation to discover instances of intragenic transcription that are regulated by cellular stresses, in order to study the roles that this transcription might play in the stress response.

Preliminary results from this work appear in <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jc_thesis_2019_07_02.pdf#3b">chapter 4 of my PhD dissertation</a>.

As a graduate student (now postdoc) in the <a href="https://winstonlab.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Fred Winston lab</a>, I am doing data science/data engineering work on a project studying potential functions for **intragenic transcription** in wild-type *S. cerevisiae*.
We are applying high-resolution assays of transcription initiation to discover instances of intragenic transcription that are regulated by cellular stresses, and are studying the roles that stress-regulated intragenic transcription may play in the response to stress.
